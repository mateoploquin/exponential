## About Mateo

> “In all my years of teaching, I’ve never seen anyone like you. From startups to hackathons and conferences, you never stop.”  
> — my first-year Parallel Computing professor

That line captured my operating system: **quiet persistence, fast learning, and navigating new environments with focus and depth**. I’ve lived in **Hong Kong, Paris, Mexico City, Istanbul, Zurich, Dublin** (and more), which sharpened my **adaptability**—I learn fast, get to the root cause, and iterate with low ego and high energy. I recently stepped down from La Info Positiva to pursue my long-held dream: **move to San Francisco** and build with ambitious teams.

Outside work I compete in **boxing 🥊 and tennis 🎾**—I love challenges, especially mental ones.

I recently quit my role at **La Info Positiva** to pursue my dream: moving to **San Francisco** to immerse myself in AI startups.
