## About Me  

> “In all my years of teaching, I’ve never seen anyone like you. From startups to hackathons, you never stop.”  
> — my first-year professor  

That’s me in a line: **quiet persistence + fast learning + founder energy**.  
I’ve lived in **Hong Kong, Paris, Mexico City, Istanbul, Zurich, Dublin**—which taught me how to adapt anywhere and keep momentum no matter the context.  

I just stepped down from leading **La Info Positiva** to go all-in on SF. Outside work, you’ll find me competing in **boxing 🥊** and **tennis 🎾**—I like challenges that test both mind and grit.

## 🥊 Story Time: The Day I Fought “Baby Hulk”  

When I lived in **Hong Kong**, I joined a small boxing gym where the coach spoke no English. For weeks we trained daily, communicating only through movements. One day, he invited me to what he called a *“friendly tournament.”*  

I walked in expecting sparring… and found myself in a packed fight night. My opponent was introduced as **“Baby Hulk,”** the crowd roared in Cantonese, and I had no corner—just a stranger handing me water.  

Round one: brutal. I was overwhelmed and taking hits. Round two: cornered, out of breath, facing a flurry of punches. Then something clicked—instinct took over. I threw everything into a single shot. The bell rang, the ref jumped in—**Baby Hulk was out cold.**  

I’d won my first-ever fight, in a foreign city, against the local favorite. Later I discovered I’d broken my hand with that punch. The lesson stuck: **when cornered, adapt fast and swing with everything you’ve got.**
