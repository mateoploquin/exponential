**Best with:** Product strategy • AI/LLM integrations (LangChain, GPT, Claude) • React / React Native (Expo) • Marketplace & SaaS design • Growth loops • Early-stage company building  
**Familiar with:** SQL/Python for analytics • Firebase • Chrome extensions • RAG pipelines • Content virality (IG/TikTok/YouTube)

## About Mateo

Madrid-based, raised between Mexico, US, and France — I’ve lived in **14 cities across 8 countries**. This gave me a global outlook and resilience: from touring Europe as a competitive tennis player, to bootstrapping startups with <100€ in the bank, to pitching on stage at the Start Summit in Switzerland.  

I graduated in 2025 with a dual degree in **Business Administration & Data Science** at IE University.
